#Antarctic icefish
The myoglobin gene of the Antarctic icefish, Chaenocephalus aceratus, contains a duplicated TATAAAA sequence that interferes with transcription. J. Exp. Biol. 206, 131-139 (2003). Icefish play a crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem, serving as prey for larger predators and helping to maintain the delicate balance of the marine food web. Conclusion. In conclusion, icefish are unique creatures that have adapted to survive in extremely cold and harsh environments. These fascinating fish have a number of interesting ...

Antarctic fishes, including icefish species, diverged from the stickleback lineage approximately 77 million years ago 7. For comparison with the chromosomes of the blackfin icefish, 21 stickleback ... To understand how the genome of the fish changed as it migrated into warmer waters, Rivera-Col√≥n compared the genetics of the pike icefish to that of an Antarctic species of icefish, C. gunnari ...
