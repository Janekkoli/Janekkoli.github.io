A sister relationship between D. anguillare and Synaphobranchidae species was discovered, which demonstrated that D. anguillare was closely related to Simenchelys parasitica, Ilyophis brunneus and Synaphobranchus kaupii. At present, various taxonomic references have different taxonomic positions for D. anguillare.
