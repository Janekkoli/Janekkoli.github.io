The myoglobin gene of the Antarctic icefish, Chaenocephalus aceratus, contains a duplicated TATAAAA sequence that interferes with transcription. J. Exp. Biol. 206, 131-139 (2003). More information: Gianni M Castiglione et al, Adaptation of Antarctic Icefish Vision to Extreme Environments, Molecular Biology and Evolution (2023). DOI: 10.1093/molbev/msad030. To understand how the genome of the fish changed as it migrated into warmer waters, Rivera-Colón compared the genetics of the pike icefish to that of an Antarctic species of icefish, C. gunnari ... These changes are predicted to have occurred during two key periods in Antarctic icefish history: the evolution of antifreeze glycoproteins and the onset of freezing polar conditions. This timing suggests that these variants were associated with icefish adaptation and speciation in response to climatic events. The 16 species of icefish are known for their eerie translucent appearance and lack of hemoglobin—the only vertebrates out of 70,000 species to lack this vital oxygen transport protein and red blood cells. "The reason they could do that was the water became extremely cold, and cold water dissolves more oxygen than warm water," Detrich says.
